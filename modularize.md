# Modularize

This is a command to look at the size of each code file.

Each code file should be < 1000 lines, and ideally < 800.

This command checks the amount of lines in each code file, warns for the ones which are above this threshold, and then brainstorms with the user for how to modularize so that we don't have huge code files, and the code is laid out in a good modular fashion.
